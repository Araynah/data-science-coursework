# CMSE201 Final Project

This repository contains my final project for CMSE201—a course focused on data science and machine learning techniques. The project aims to analyze a dataset to uncover insights and build predictive models that answer a key research question in the field of [your field/subject]. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and result interpretation.

## Repository Structure

- **CMSE201_FinalProjectTemplate-Copy1.ipynb**  
  This notebook serves as a project template. It provides guidelines and a framework for the final project, including sections for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

- **ProjectCheckpoint-Araynah.ipynb**  
  This notebook captures a checkpoint of the project. It includes:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
  - Implementation and evaluation of models
  - Visualizations and insights drawn from the data

- *(Other files or directories as applicable, such as datasets or supplementary scripts.)*

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to answer a specific research question in the field of [your field/subject]. In this project, I:
- **Explore & Clean Data:** Investigate raw data, handle missing values, and prepare data for analysis.
- **Develop Models:** Implement machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- **Evaluate & Visualize:** Assess model performance and generate visualizations to interpret the findings.
- **Report Findings:** Use the provided template to structure the final report, detailing methodology, analysis, and conclusions.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow—from data exploration to final reporting—showcasing practical applications of data science in real-world scenarios.
