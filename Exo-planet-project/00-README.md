# ðŸŒŒ Exoplanetary Systems Analysis | CMSE201 Final Project

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between **stellar mass** and the **structure of planetary systems**, focusing on the implications for **habitability**. Using the *All Exoplanets Dataset* from **Kaggle**, I explored whether a star's mass correlates with:
1. The number of planets it hosts
2. The presence of potential habitable zones

The project includes:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations (scatter plots, boxplots, heatmaps)
- Basic habitability assessment
- Final results and interpretation

## Data Source  
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  
ðŸ“‚ [All Exoplanets Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/all-exoplanets-dataset)  
It contains **confirmed exoplanets** and their host star properties up to **2021**.  
This dataset was crucial in helping answer two main research questions:
1. Is there a relationship between stellar mass and the number of planets?
2. Are there planetary systems similar to ours with potential habitable zones?

## Approach Summary

### âœ… Data Preparation
- Loaded the Kaggle dataset into Python.
- Selected relevant columns for planetary systems and stellar masses.
- Converted absolute stellar mass to a **solar-relative scale** (i.e., in units of the Sunâ€™s mass).
- Filtered, cleaned, and restructured the data for analysis.

### âœ… Visualizations
- **Boxplot**: Showed distribution of stellar masses across systems.
- **Scatter Plot**: Explored the relationship between mass and planet counts.
- **Heatmap**: Revealed frequency patterns between stellar mass and system multiplicity.

### âœ… Habitable Zone Modeling
- Implemented basic habitable zone formulas to approximate **habitable distances**.
- Identified planetary systems that are likely to have conditions similar to those in our solar system.

### âœ… Results
- Found that stars with masses similar to the Sun are more likely to host **multi-planet** systems.
- Identified **two systems** with planets inside habitable zones.
- Noted that high-mass stars tend to have **fewer planets**, supporting theories about star formation and evolution.

## Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Kaggle** for dataset acquisition

## Notes
This project represents a full end-to-end workflow:
- From **data acquisition** (Kaggle)
- To **exploratory data analysis**
- To **interpretation of scientific results**
- All summarized in the attached **PDF report** and demonstrated step-by-step in the notebook.

## ðŸŒŸ Personal Reflection
This project challenged me to:
- Apply theoretical data science skills to a **real-world astrophysics problem**
- Balance **data visualization** with **scientific insight**
- Perform **habitability modeling** for the first time
- Gain confidence working with **real astronomical datasets** using Python
